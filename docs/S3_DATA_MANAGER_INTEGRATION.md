# S3 Data Manager - DNA Sequencing Module

## Overview
The S3 Data Manager has been successfully implemented as a dedicated sub-feature in the DNA Sequencing sidebar menu. It appears right after the AI Genomics Lab option and provides a standalone interface for managing genomics data files and analysis results in AWS S3.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Sidebar Integration
- **Location**: DNA Sequencing → S3 Data Manager (after AI Genomics Lab)
- **Icon**: `ri-cloud-fill` for consistent cloud storage representation
- **Route**: `/dna-sequencing/s3-data-manager`
- **Permissions**: Protected by `canAccessDnaSequencingModule`

### 2. Standalone S3 Data Manager Page
- **Full-page Interface**: Dedicated page with comprehensive S3 management
- **Connection Status**: Real-time AWS S3 connection indicators
- **Bucket Statistics**: Quick overview cards for all available buckets
- **Usage Guidelines**: Built-in best practices and security information

### 3. Main Components
- **S3DataManager Component** (`src/components/s3/S3DataManager.jsx`)
  - File browser with grid/list view options
  - Upload progress tracking with demo simulation
  - Bulk operations (select all, download selected)
  - Search and filter capabilities
  - Folder navigation support
  - Bucket selector for switching between storage buckets

### 4. Configuration System
- **S3 Configuration** (`src/config/s3DataManagerConfig.js`)
  - Soft-coded feature toggles
  - Bucket configurations (genomics-data, genomics-results, genomics-models, genomics-backup)
  - Operation settings (upload, download, delete, copy, move)
  - UI customization options
  - Security and validation rules

## How to Use

### Step 1: Navigate to S3 Data Manager
1. Go to the DNA Sequencing module
2. Click on "S3 Data Manager" in the sidebar (after AI Genomics Lab)
3. The page will load with connection status and bucket overview

### Step 2: Browse and Manage Files
1. **Select Bucket**: Use the dropdown to switch between different S3 buckets
2. **Browse Files**: Navigate through folders and files in grid or list view
3. **Search**: Use the search bar to filter files by name or type
4. **Upload**: Click "Upload Files" to add new data (demo simulation)
5. **Download**: Select files and use bulk download options

### Step 3: Monitor Storage
- View bucket statistics in the overview cards
- Check connection status in the header
- Review usage guidelines for best practices

## Bucket Organization

### Available Buckets
```javascript
buckets: [
  { id: 'genomics-data', name: 'Genomics Data', description: 'Raw sequencing data and input files' },
  { id: 'genomics-results', name: 'Analysis Results', description: 'AI analysis outputs and reports' },
  { id: 'genomics-models', name: 'AI Models', description: 'Trained models and configurations' },
  { id: 'genomics-backup', name: 'Backup Storage', description: 'Backup and archived data' }
]
```

### Sample Data Structure
- **genomics-data**: Raw FASTQ files, reference genomes, quality control data
- **genomics-results**: Aligned BAM files, variant calls (VCF), analysis reports
- **genomics-models**: DeepVariant models, GATK CNN models, custom AI models
- **genomics-backup**: Monthly backups, archived projects

## Technical Implementation

### Route Configuration
```jsx
{
  path: '/dna-sequencing/s3-data-manager',
  element: <S3DataManagerPage />,
}
```

### Sidebar Menu Entry
```jsx
{ 
  path: "/dna-sequencing/s3-data-manager", 
  name: "S3 Data Manager", 
  icon: "ri-cloud-fill" 
}
```

### Component Architecture
```jsx
<S3DataManagerPage>
  ├── Connection Status Alert
  ├── Bucket Statistics Cards
  ├── S3DataManager Component
  │   ├── Bucket Selector
  │   ├── File Browser
  │   ├── Upload Modal
  │   └── Bulk Operations
  └── Usage Guidelines
</S3DataManagerPage>
```

## Features

### 1. Full-Page Experience
- Dedicated page for S3 management
- Connection status monitoring
- Bucket overview statistics
- Comprehensive file operations

### 2. Enhanced File Management
- **Bucket Switching**: Easy selection between different storage buckets
- **File Operations**: Upload, download, delete, search, and filter
- **View Modes**: Grid and list views for different preferences
- **Bulk Actions**: Select multiple files for batch operations

### 3. User Experience
- **Responsive Design**: Works across different screen sizes
- **Intuitive Interface**: Familiar file manager-style operations
- **Visual Feedback**: Progress bars, status indicators, and alerts
- **Help Integration**: Built-in usage guidelines and best practices

## Security & Permissions

### Access Control
- Protected by DNA Sequencing module permissions
- Role-based access to different buckets
- Audit logging for all operations
- Encrypted data at rest

### Best Practices
- Organized folder structure recommendations
- File naming conventions
- Backup and versioning strategies
- Security compliance guidelines

## Benefits

1. **Standalone Access**: Dedicated interface separate from AI workflows
2. **Comprehensive Management**: Full S3 operations in one place
3. **User-Friendly**: Intuitive file management experience
4. **Scalable**: Supports multiple buckets and large datasets
5. **Educational**: Built-in guidelines and best practices

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real AWS Integration**: Connect to actual S3 buckets
2. **Advanced Permissions**: Granular access control per bucket
3. **File Previews**: Quick preview for genomics file formats
4. **Metadata Management**: Tag and categorize files
5. **Automated Workflows**: Integration with analysis pipelines
6. **Storage Analytics**: Usage reports and cost optimization

The S3 Data Manager now provides a complete, standalone file management experience within the DNA Sequencing module, making it easy for users to manage their genomics data storage needs.
