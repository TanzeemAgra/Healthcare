# S3 Data Manager Error Fix - Summary

## Issue Description
The S3 Data Manager page was throwing a React Router error:
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')
at S3DataManagerPage (S3DataManagerPage.jsx:58:78)
```

## Root Cause
The error occurred because the S3DataManagerPage component was trying to access `S3_DATA_MANAGER_CONFIG.buckets.length`, but the configuration only had buckets defined as an object under `s3Config.buckets`, not as a top-level array.

## Files Modified
1. **`src/config/s3DataManagerConfig.js`**: Added top-level `buckets` array

## Solution Applied
Added a top-level `buckets` array to the S3_DATA_MANAGER_CONFIG with the following structure:

```javascript
buckets: [
  { 
    id: 'genomics-data', 
    name: 'Genomics Data', 
    description: 'Raw sequencing data and input files',
    icon: 'ri-dna-line',
    color: 'primary' 
  },
  { 
    id: 'genomics-results', 
    name: 'Analysis Results', 
    description: 'AI analysis outputs and reports',
    icon: 'ri-file-chart-line',
    color: 'success' 
  },
  { 
    id: 'genomics-models', 
    name: 'AI Models', 
    description: 'Trained models and configurations',
    icon: 'ri-brain-line',
    color: 'info' 
  },
  { 
    id: 'genomics-backup', 
    name: 'Backup Storage', 
    description: 'Backup and archived data',
    icon: 'ri-archive-line',
    color: 'warning' 
  }
]
```

## Verification
✅ S3 Data Manager page loads without errors
✅ Bucket statistics display correctly
✅ Bucket selector works properly
✅ No compilation errors
✅ Demo data generation works with correct bucket IDs

## Current Status
The S3 Data Manager is now fully functional at:
`http://localhost:5173/dna-sequencing/s3-data-manager`

Both the bucket statistics and the S3DataManager component now properly access the buckets array for UI rendering and functionality.
