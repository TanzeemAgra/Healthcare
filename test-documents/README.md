## üßπ Cleanup Purpose

These files were moved here to maintain a clean project structure while preserving valuable debugging and testing resources that might be useful for:

2. **Testing methodology**: Examples of how to test various features
3. **Development documentation**: Historical record of the debugging process

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- These files are **not part of the production codebase**
- They can be safely deleted if disk space is needed
- Some scripts may have hardcoded values specific to the development environment
- Review and update any paths/URLs before reusing these scripts

## üóëÔ∏è Safe to Delete

If you want to clean up further, this entire `test-documents` folder can be safely deleted without affecting the main application functionality.
